# SQL Learning Journey & Projects
A collection of my SQL learning notes, exercises, and project analyses.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal compilation of my progress in learning SQL, encompassing fundamental concepts, advanced queries, and practical data analysis projects. The aim is to document my journey, reinforce my understanding, and provide shareable examples of SQL applications.

## Files Included
- `Week 1 SQL.pdf`: Introduction to Databases.
Covers:
Definition of a database.
Types of databases (Relational, NoSQL, In-memory).
Database components (Tables, Rows, Columns).
Practical Aspects:
MySQL installation and configuration steps.
Importing an IMDB dataset.
Basic operations like showing tables.

- `Week 2 SQL.pdf`: The SELECT Query.
Covers:
Retrieving data from a database.
WHERE clause for filtering data.
Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
Comparison operators (BETWEEN, IN, LIKE).
Wildcards (%, _) for pattern matching.
Introduces: Aggregate functions (COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), SUM()).

- `Week 3 SQL.pdf`: Advanced SQL Concepts.
Covers:
GROUP BY clause for data summarization with aggregate functions.
Various JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, SELF JOIN) for combining tables.
Subqueries (nested queries) as scalar, single-row, multi-row, and correlated.
Operators with subqueries (IN, =, ANY, ALL, EXISTS).

- `Week 4 SQL.pdf`: Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL).
DML Commands:
SELECT: Retrieving data.
INSERT: Adding new rows.
UPDATE: Modifying existing data.
DELETE: Removing specific rows.
DCL Commands:
GRANT: Assigning user permissions.
REVOKE: Removing user permissions.
Focus: Modifying data and managing database access.

## Projects
Detailed SQL analysis projects are included, showcasing practical applications of SQL:
- **Bookstore Analysis:** Explores customer behavior, book sales, and inventory management.
   This document details a SQL project focused on a bookstore database. It begins with the creation of the bookstore database and its tables (Books, Customers, Orders). The core of the document
   appears to be 20 SQL analysis questions, with examples like retrieving all books in the "Fiction" genre, and queries to find customers who spent the most on orders, including result grids for verification.
   Database schema design, data insertion, and a variety of SQL queries for analytical purposes (filtering, aggregation, ordering, joining).
- **Pizza Sales Analysis:** Provides insights into sales trends, popular pizza types, and revenue generation.
   This PDF outlines a SQL project for analyzing pizza sales. It starts with the creation of a pizza database and its related tables (orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types). The document then
   proceeds to address 13 SQL analysis questions, such as calculating total orders, total revenue from pizza sales, identifying the highest-priced pizza, and determining top ordered pizza types based on revenue.
   Database setup for sales data, calculating key performance indicators, and analyzing sales trends using SQL queries.
